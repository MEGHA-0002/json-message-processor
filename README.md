A simple JavaScript project that demonstrates JSON parsing and error handling.
The program:
- Converts user details (name, email, message) from JSON text into a JavaScript object
- Uses a named arrow function to print "Message received from <name>"
- Implements try-catch to gracefully handle invalid or broken JSON
- Outputs the result in the console

This project improved my understanding of JSON parsing, arrow functions, and error handling in JavaScript.
